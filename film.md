---

I've always been an avid lover of photography, albeit, I found that my artistic expression gravitated towards capturing incredible pictures with non-specialised equipment. I started on an iPhone, and one fateful day, my grandfather passed to me his old film camera, pristinely preserved for the better part of 3 decades and well - the rest was history.
